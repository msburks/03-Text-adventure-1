Peer's repository:https://github.com/msburks/03-Text-adventure-1



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

I didn't allow choosing different games, so that was interesting.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

For a text adventure project, the banner was cool to have and simple to implement. 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

Really not much. Nitpicky, but there's a few typos in the .json file. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

Took me a second to realize that the verbs were "Forward Left Right Back" instead of "North South East West" 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Didn't know why there was only one option for a game to play, but understood after reading the readme.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 More description on why the project was created or what it is

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Enjoyed the game overall. Having the banner was a nice touch
